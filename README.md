# hello-world
This will be my intro to the world and online activities.
Hi, my name is Christopher T Nash. I am 39 years old. I love music. I play guitar, piano and sing a little bit. I used to draw but haven't drawn in quite a while. Hopefully, I can get better at web development and start something online.
Commit- I think it wise to tell more ppl about me and so I added more info.
